# Spring-Boot-API-CH
To run the application first dowanload or clone the codbase.
Then open up your favourate IDE. I prefer eclipse.
After that import the project as Maven Project and wait few minutes to let the project dowanload all necessary libraries
Once the dowanload is finished and prject build is successfull then run the project as "Spring Boot App"
But before running the application make sure you have MySQL 5 and jdk 8 installed and you already have a database called "twentyfourhourcoding"
In the application.properties please change the database name, username and password according to yours.
