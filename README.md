# Spring-Boot-API-CH
To run the application first dowanload or clone the codbase.
Then open up your favourate IDE. I prefer eclipse.
After that import the project as Maven Project and wait few minutes to let the project dowanload all necessary libraries
Once the dowanload is finished and prject built is successfull then run the project as "Spring Boot App"
